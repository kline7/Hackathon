WildFire hackathon

In the fight to reduce the impact of wild fires we must find the cause of these fires. 
This code creates a deep learning neural network to determine whether a wildifre was caused by nature of human-based sources. The data used to train the model was gathered from three different sources.

The data that is used for training should be in a data folder.
